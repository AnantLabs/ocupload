=Proposed Features=
===File Que===
Could use one upload element to select more than one file at a time and submit them at the same time. Could keep track of what files are in the que and remove files if needed.
===Mouseover/Hover Effects===
====Problem====
Because the input form is placed over top of the element with opacity 0 the hover effects of the underlying element are ignored.
====Solutions====
Maybe it is possible to read the css of the underlying element and apply the hover styles manually when the mouse is in the area of the element?

===Mouseover Icon===
====Problem====
File input element does not support changing the cursor
====Solutions====
It may be helpful to place a small image beside the cursor when mousing over the element?
