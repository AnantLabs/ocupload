==Proposed Features==
===Mouseover/Hover Effects===
====Problem====
Because the input form is placed over top of the element with opacity 0 the hover effects of the underlying element are ignored.
====Solutions====
Maybe it is possible to read the css of the underlying element and apply the hover styles manually when the mouse is in the area of the element?

===Mouseover Icon===
====Problem====
File input element does not support changing the cursor
====Solutions====
It may be helpful to place a small image beside the cursor when mousing over the element?
